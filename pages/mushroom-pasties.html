    <img src="../img/mushroom-pasties.jpg">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>450g home-made or bought shortcrust pastry, thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>450g button mushrooms</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>50g Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dry mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p>
        Use two-thirds of the pastry to line small, deep pans. Chill while making the filling. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Trim off and discard the bottoms of the mushroom stems, then dip the mushrooms in boiling salted water, holding them in a sieve. Drain them, pat dry, then chop or slice them. Put them in a bowl and mix them with the oil, cheese and seasonings. Fill the mixture into the pastry cases. Roll out the remaining pastry and use it to make lids for the pasties. Seal the lids with beaten egg. Decorate the tops with pastry trimmings and brush with the remaining egg. Make a small crosscut in the centre of each lid. Bake the little pies in the oven for 15-18 minutes. Serve warm.
