    <img src="../img/mutton-stew.jpeg">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>900g boneless stewing lamb or mutton</li>
            <li>425ml chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1/2-1 tsp each fresh rosemary leaves, thyme leaves, and savory or marjoram leaves, bruised in a mill (use less if using dried herbs)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp each ground ginger, cumin and coriander</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>225ml white wine</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p>
            Cut the meat into 5cm cubes. Put the stock into a stewpan and bring to the boil. Add the meat and bring back to the boil. Skim if needed, then add the prepared onions, herbs, spices, salt and wine. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and cook gently until the meat cubes are cooked through and tender (1â€“1 1/2 hours). Beat the eggs with the lemon juice until blended, then take the pan off the heat and stir the egg mixture gradually into the stew to thicken it slightly. Do not re-boil.
