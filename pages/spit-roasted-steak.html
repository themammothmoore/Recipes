    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Base</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>6 fairly think beef steaks</li>
        <li>Oil or fat for grilling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Basting Sauce:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp Seville orange juice</li>
        <li>4 tbsp red wine</li>
        <li>Pinch each of ground black pepper or ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Garnish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sprinking of ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p>The original recipe calls for 'verjuice', a popular medieval condiment made from specially grown or (in England) unripe grapes. But another recipe from the Medieval household book Le Ménagier de Paris (the Goodman of Paris) suggests using the juice of Seville oranges. If you can get these in season and freeze them, you can use their juice as a substitute for verjuice – it makes a delicious sauce. Nick the edges of the steaks and grease them. Mix the sauce ingredients in a jug, adjusting the proportions if you wish. Then grill the steaks as you prefer. Warm the sauce and sprinkle a few drops over the meat while grilling it. Serve the steaks lightly sprinkled with cinnamon and any remaining sauce.</p>
